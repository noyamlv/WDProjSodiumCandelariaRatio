On July 20, 6767, at approximately 6:07 p.m., the body of Tooru Oikawa, a student and volleyball player at Aoba Johsai High School, was discovered in the [ where bro ] locker room. The locker room door was locked at the time and was opened by teammate Hajime Iwaizumi, who reported the incident. Upon entry, Iwaizumi observed Oikawa lying unresponsive on the floor with significant blood present on the surrounding lockers and tiles. A blood-stained dagger was found near the victim's body, consistent with apparent stab wounds. Emergency services were notified immediately, and responding officers secured the scene upon arrival. The victim was pronounced dead at the scene, and the locker room was treated as a restricted crime scene pending further forensic examination.


**Act I**
Setting:
    3 days before the Spring High Tournament rematch against Karasuno.
    The atmosphere at Aoba Johsai is tense as Oikawa Tooru, teh team's leader and ace setter has been practicing late every night, hiding a limp he claims is "just stiffness and result of too much games"

Primary Suspect: Kageyama Tobio

- Multiple students claim they saw Kage entering the Aoba Johsai's gym at around 4 pm on teh dau of the death. Oikawa was heard saying "Show me what you've got, Tobio-kun or wtv,which implied a private practice rally"
- Yama's team towel, embroidered with his name, was found soaked in blood near Oikawa's body. Additionally, Oinkawa's jacket was missing and was lateer found stuffed inside Kageyama's gym bag at Krasuno.
- Rumors are going around --- Oinkawa was planning to reveal that Kageyama had been skipping team practicces, which would have gotten kageyama suspended for the rematch
- Kageyama refuses to provide an alibi for the time of death, js staring at the police repeating "I didn't think he'd actually do it"

**Act II**
The Autopsy Report:
    The initial assumption was death by exsanguination from teh stab wounds, but the forensic toxicology report reveeals:

    Cause of Death: Acute overdoes of sedatives (Zolpidem)
    The Wounds: The stab wounds were inflicted after the cardiac arrest. There was no defensive tissue reaction
    Implication: This was a staged suicide made to look liek a murder

The Sleepign Pills;
The sedatives found in Oikawa's system match a prescription belonging toIwaizumi's uncle, a local clinician. Iwa had been seen picking up this prescription weeks prior. So ngayon, ang suspect na ay si Iwa. Did he try to poison Oikawa then stab him? But WHy though?

**Act III**
Interrogation records reveal that Iwa *did* attempt to kill Oikawa, but not out of hate (?)

- 2 weeks prior, Iwa found Oink's hidden medical scans. Oikawa's knees were degenerating rapidly; he'd be in a wheelchair by age 25. This is why bro was practicing late and also the limping
- Iwa, unabel to watch his best friend suffer a slow, painful whatever, crushed the pills into Oink's tea one night. He intended it to be painless, like a soft, gentle release. It was his final act of love to spare him of his future agony (tf bro)
- Oikawa woke up halfway through, though. But he didn't fight. He looked at Iwa with hollow eyes and said liek (luh ang corny) "Not like this. I want to go out on the court." Iwa stopped. Oikawa kept the remaining pills.
- Iwa knew he provided the means. He broke down the locker room door knowing what he might find, hoping against hope he was wrong.

**Act IV**
- Hinata admits to walking around Aoba Johsai that afternoon. He tells the police he saw kageyama leaving the rocker loom at 5:30 pm, looking pale and shaking
- Oikawa knew Hinata was a bum so he perfectly timed his death. He opened teh locker room window slightly before taking the pills, knowing Hinata would be peeking through. But where Oikawa was positioned couldn't be seen from Hinata's point of view. Hinata could onyl see Kageyama..
- Oikawa's missing armband was found in Hinata's possession. Hinata claims he found it on teh ground outside the lockder room window. Oikawa actually threw it out the window.
- Basically, Oikawa used Hinata's honesty to cement Kagyema's alibi gap

**Act V**
Found on Oikawa's phone was a number addressed to an unknown number, which was later found out to be Ushijima's

- 2 days before his death, Oikawa met with Ushijima privately. He didn't ask for advice, they just spoke. Oikawa said "If I retire due to injury, I am weak. If I am murdered, it is a tragedy. But if I make teh king my suspect, I become a ghost that never leaves him" or "Ushijima, you say that strength is everthing. Is it stronger to let my body rot until I'm pitied? Or is it stronget to choose my end while I'm still a King?"
- ushijima tried to talk him out od it, arguing that overcoming adversity was true strength, btu Oikawa argued. Ushijima, bound by his own philospohy of respecting a player's will, froze. He didn't stop Oikawa.
- After the death, when Ushijima was questioned about OIkawa's physical state, he lied. He told the investifators, "Oikawa jumped higher than ever yesterday. His condition's peak." He lied to ensure Oikawa wasn't pitied as his wish.
- In the message, OIkawa said "Make sure Tobio knwos this was my choice. But don't tell the world," Ushijima realized that if Kageyama was cleared too easily, OIkwa's death would be forgotten. Ushijima subtly mentioned teh rivalry narrative in his own t estimony.

**Act VI**
The final letter found near Oikawa

Oikawa couldn't accept a future where he was pitied. He wanted to ensure Kageyama would never enjoy a victory wihtout feeling Oikawa's shadow. "He wanted to be the King? Then tell him rule a kingdom of ghosts."

The door was locked from the inside usinga string mechanism found later in the trash

**Resolution**
- Kageyama is legally cleared due to the suicide ruling, but the volleyball community forever whispers that he drove Oikawa to death. He later finds a hidden note from Ushijima that hints at the truth, but by then, the guilt is already part of him. He plays volleyball with a heaviness that never leaves.
- Hinata: Struggles with the guilt that his testimony almost sent an innocent man to prison, though he now knows the "victim" was the architect. 
- Iwaizumi lives with the double guilt of attempting the mercy kill and providing the pills. He quits volleyball, unable to look at a court without seeing Oikawa's final set. He holds the burden that his "act of love" became the weapon for Oikawa's final act of vengeance.
- Ushijima becomes the silent guardian of the truth. He wins the championship that year, but when asked about Oikawa, he simply says, "He was a formidable setter. Until the end." He carries the secret that he helped bury the truth to protect Oikawa's pride, even at the cost of Kageyama's sanity.

**The End**
Ushijima would say watching Kageyama play alone in the dark "He didn't just kill himself." "He set the ball so perfectly that none of us could ever spike it away. And I... I refused to block it."
