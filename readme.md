# __Website Outline__

**Start Page**
    The site page that the player first sees when they open the website. This will have buttons leading the player to see the description of the website/what the game is/what the game is about and some small things like inspirations, etc. and also the button making the player start the game itself.

**About Page**
	This is where the player will be able to see what the game is about, what the game is, inspirations, etc.

**__Home Page__ || The Case File.**
	Where the main case is introduced — the murder of Tooru Oikawa. It will feature a concise summary of the case and a call to action. There will also be a gallery of clickable suspect profiles which the user can review. 

**__The Evidence Board__ || Clues.**
	This is where all the gathered clues and evidence are presented in an organized list or detective board. This allows the user to see the connections they’re making in their investigation.

**__Interrogation Room__ || Question the Suspects.**
	This is where users conduct their interviews. It contains the different suspect profiles which the user could select to interrogate, which would show a specific interface for that character, a set of questions to ask and a log of their previous responses and statements.

**__Final Accusation__: Naming the Culprit.**
	This is where the user will declare their final accusation against a suspect whom they think is the culprit. They’ll be asked to choose from the list of the suspects who they think the culprit is. They would then be guided to formulate their reasoning by connecting the pieces of evidence they uncovered to explain the method, the trick and the clarification for the contradictions that would prove their accusation. 

**__The Reveal__: There is only one truth.**
	This provides the conclusion to the story. Users are directed to this after their final accusation. It would be revealed here who the culprit was and how they did the crime from their perspective.

**How Javascript will be incorporated:** Javascript will primarily be used in the *Final Accusation* page. Javascript will handle the more interactive features like the different outcomes based off who the user chooses who the culprit is. Additionally, it will also be used for showing the final verdict or reveal screen after the user submits their choice. It will also be primarily used in the *Case File* page/*Home Page* as well in which it will show the different files of the different possible suspects.

**Initial Wireframe:**
